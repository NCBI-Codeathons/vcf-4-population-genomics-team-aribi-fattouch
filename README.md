### About the tool
  <br>
[Tool name] is an interactive visualization tool of SARSCOV-2 virus genetic variantion, in relation to diseases comorbidity.
  
The initial supported diseases list includes: 

     * Cancer
       
     * Autoimmune diseases
     
     * neurological  conditions
       
     * Diabetes

### Usage

The tool is a shiny application deployed as an R package.

#### Input

The tool requires VCF file as input.

#### Output

Features list : 

   - .
     
   - .
     
   - .
  
### Installation

The package could be installed as follows:

    install.packages("devtools")

    Library(devtools)

    devtools::install_github("NCBI-Codeathons/vcf-4-population-genomics-team-aribi-fattouch/Package")

    Library([ Tool name] )
   
### Implementation and Operation

The tool is: 
   
    Requiement: basic computational skills to use ( install R package and run it)
   
    platform independency : 
   
    libraries dependencies : all dependencies are installed automatically with the tool
   
    Internet requirement:
   
    Third party tools requirement: R studio or a online Server
   
    Pre-requirements: R installation
