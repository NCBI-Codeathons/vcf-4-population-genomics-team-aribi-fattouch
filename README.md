## Project Goals
The aim of this project is to develop an advanced tool in the form of a Shiny application, deployed as an R package, for visualizing SARS-CoV-2 variants using VCF files
<br><br>
## Approach

1. Define the Project Scope and Objectives: 
   - Clearly outline the goals and objectives of the tool 
   - Identify the specific features, types of visualizations, and functionalities to include in the Shiny application

2. Gather and Preprocess Data:
   - Collect publicly available SARS-CoV-2 VCF files 
   - Preprocess the data 

3.  Data Visualization:
   - Develop R code to create interactive and informative visualizations of genetic variations.

4. Develop the Shiny Application:
   - Use the Shiny R package to build the interactive web application.
   - Integrate the data visualization code within the Shiny app.

5. Create the R Package:
   - Convert the Shiny application into an R package.
   - Document the package ( based on Bioconductor best practices)

6. Perform Validation and Testing:
   - Use publicly available datasets with known results to validate the accuracy and performance of the prediction and characterization tools.


7. Documentation and User Guides:
   - Document the tool on GitHub
   - Prepare comprehensive documentation and user guides explaining how to use the Shiny application and R package effectively.

### Installation

The package could be installed as follows:

    install.packages("devtools")

    Library(devtools)

    devtools::install_github("NCBI-Codeathons/vcf-4-population-genomics-team-aribi-fattouch/Package")

    Library([ Tool name] )
   
### Implementation and Operation

The tool is: 
   
    Requiement: basic computational skills to use ( install R package and run it)
   
    platform independency : 
   
    libraries dependencies : all dependencies are installed automatically with the tool
   
    Internet requirement:
   
    Third party tools requirement: R studio or a online Server
   
    Pre-requirements: R installation
